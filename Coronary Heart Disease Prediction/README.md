### Functionalities
- [x]  Manually tune parameters of different ML algorithms to get the best result on the **Framingham** Heart Disease dataset.

### The different ML models presented here are:

* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Classifier
* k-Nears Neighbour Classifier
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* Gradient Boosting Classifier
* XGBoost Classifier


### About the Dataset:
The dataset used here is the **Framingham** Coronary Heart Disease dataset publicly available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/amanajmera1/framingham-heart-study-dataset).

The Framingham dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes over 4,240 records and 15 attributes.

Even after optimizing parameters, the model would only work properly if accurate data is provided to it. So, through this web app, will help the users to be able to get a feel of hyperparameter tuning but only on *this specific dataset.*
