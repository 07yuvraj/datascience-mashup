# Adult Census Income

In this project our task is to determine weather a person makes over 50K a year or not.It is a binary classification based dataset. For creating the model I followed 2 meathods , first I trained the model using Logistic Regression in which I got an accuracy score of around 84.44 percent . Second I used ANN or Artificial Neural Network in which I used 'relu' function as activation function of first and second hidden layer , and sigmoid function for last layer. Using ANN I got an accuracy score of 84.468 percent after 50 epochs.I have used Google Colab to train and test the model as we can train the model using GPU in Colab and that is very fast as compared to CPU.

## About the dataset
