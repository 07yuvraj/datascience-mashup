CONCRETE STRENGTH PREDICTION:

Predicting the compressive strength of concrete  Deep Nueral Networks.

EXISTING SOCIETAL ISSUE:

In earlier days, the concrete strength is measure through other traditional methods like using drill holes, weight spring, or using sensors. 
But that requires a significant destruction of test sample and thereby increasing the cost.
The recommended wait time for testing the cylinder is 28 days to ensure correct results.
This consumes a lot of time and requires a lot of labour to prepare different prototypes and test them. 
Also, this method is prone to human error and one small mistake can cause the wait time to drastically increase.

PROPOSED SOLUTION:

The focus of this project is the application of machine learning process,
Artificial nueral networks and their suitability to model concrete compressive strength compared with early models obtained from the literature
And compared with some conventional approaches and also a recoomendation system is developed by applying various ML methods,Deep nueral network methods
to predict the concrete strength from its components accurately and then looking for the optimal combination of components which increases the strength.
