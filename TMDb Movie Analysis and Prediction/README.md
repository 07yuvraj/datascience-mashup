<h1 align="center">TMDb Movie Analysis and Comparative Modeling</h1>


### Abstract:

In this machine learning project, I cleaned, analyzed, and predicted two target variables â€“ both **revenue**
(numerical) and **profitability** (categorical), from the dataset of * **THE MOVIE DATABASE (TMDb).** *

### Aim: 

To explore the various Data Processing, Analysis and Regression and Classification Modeling
techniques required for the Dataset to provide better predictions of the Revenue or the Profitability of
a movie before its production.

### Dataset:

The dataset contains around 5000 movies with 22 features and is obtained from Kaggle [1].
The information available about each movie include its budget, revenue generated, genres, rating, vote
count, popularity, actors and actresses and any more. However, I used an unclean version of the dataset
for this project.

### Implementation:

In this project, I will use this dataset to **clean, analyze and determine** whether any information about
a movie can predict the total revenue of a movie. I will then attempt to predict whether a movie's
revenue will exceed its budget (profitability). Also, I will test **two** different models for each
prediction to check which predicts our target variable better. To sum it up, 
* For Predicting Revenue (Regression):
  * Linear Regression
  * Random Forest Regression

* For Predicting Profitability (Classification):
  * Logistic Regression
  * Random Forest Classification


The results obtained from this project will be helpful for the *Movie Production Teams* to analyze the
rubrics of their Movie Idea before it moves on to the Production Phase.
